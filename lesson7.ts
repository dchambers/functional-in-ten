/**
 * TASK:
 * Using the data given in `visitedTownsJourneyLog`, use the data to dynamically produce a journey report that looks like this:
 *
 * # Visited Towns Journey Report
 *
 * ## Largest Three Towns
 *   - London (Greater London)
 *   - Birmingham (West Midlands)
 *   - Bristol (Bristol)
 *
 * ## Smallest Three Towns
 *   - Exeter (Devon)
 *   - Oxford (Oxfordshire)
 *   - Plymouth (Devon)
 *
 * BONUS:
 * 1. Show how we can use `readonly` on function types to protect against accidental mutation.
 * 2. Add a population section to the report that looks like this:
 *
 * ## Population
 * Combined population of visited towns: 9343000
 *
 * HOMEWORK:
 *
 * 1. Add a couple more towns to the visited report and confirm that the report still generates correcdtly.
 * 2. Make the population section more comprehensive by having three bullet points:
 *    - Combined population (as we currently have)
 *    - Combined population of the largest three towns.
 *    - Combined population of the smallest three towns.
