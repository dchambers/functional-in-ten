/**
 * TASK:
 * Create functions that would have allowed us to have better reports in previous lessons:
 *
 * 1. A `displayNumber` function that comma delimits numbers so they are easier to read.
 * 2. A `delimitList` function that delimits lists with a comma for all but the final two items in
 *    the list, which it delimits with an ampersand.
 *
 * BONUS:
 * 1. Show how `import` and `export` can be used to have those reports make use of the functions defined here.
